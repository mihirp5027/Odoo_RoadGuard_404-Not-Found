🚧 RoadGuard
RoadGuard is an AI-powered web application designed to enhance road safety by identifying and reporting potholes and road cracks. It utilizes advanced image processing and machine learning models to analyze road surface conditions and predict the severity of detected damage.

🧠 Features
AI-based Detection: Detects potholes and cracks in road images using trained models.

Severity Classification: Classifies the level of damage to prioritize maintenance.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive UI for uploading and analyzing images.

Real-Time Feedback: Provides instant analysis results after image submission.

Report Generation: Generates detailed reports for each analysis.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React, typeScript,TailwindCSS

Backend: Node, express

Machine Learning: TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV

Deployment: Local server (can be extended to cloud platforms)

📸 Usage
Scan an image of a road surface.

The AI model processes the image to detect potholes/cracks.

View the analysis with severity classification and recommendations.
